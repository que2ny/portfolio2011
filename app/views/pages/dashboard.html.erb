          In 2007, Windows Live had just launched a first version of its social platform leveraging other components within Microsoft
          including MSN and Office Live, and was trying to unify its various services (Hotmail, Messenger IM, blog, photo, documents,
          profile) under the brand of Windows Live. A personalized home page under the mantra of &ldquo;Me, my people, my stuff, and my world&rdquo;
          was designed to emphasize the benefit of using a suite of services in Windows Live.

          This high-visibility site set the standard
          look & feel for entire Windows Live line of products and reached 110M unique users by the end of cycle for its first version,
          and later evolved into a timeline view of aggregated activities with Windows Live and other 3rd party networks. Its mobile browser
          version debuted in 2010.
