          In 2010, Hotmail was still the worldâ€™s largest email provider with around <em>350M</em> users and Messenger
          was the largest online chat program with <em>300M</em> users around the world. However, with the growth rate of competitors like
          Google Gmail and Facebook Chat, Windows Live (umbrella brand for both of Hotmail and Messenger) team felt threatened and
          tried to synergize the two giants, Hotmail and Messenger, even further than before. One of the efforts was providing Messenger
          on the web browser integrated with Hotmail and other Windows Live services.

          The concept wasn't new, but the specific challenges for Windows Live Web Messenger were related to <em>the emphasized integration of multiple
          web services</em> under the Windows Live brand. The Web Messenger had to be designed to work not only in Hotmail context, but also seamlessly
          carry a conversation from/to other web services like SkyDrive, Photos, Office Live and more. Such condition required good
          understanding and handling of technical limitations on top of excellent execution of UX design principles.

          I led the feature team of 3-5 developers, 3 testers, 2 designers, a UX researcher and a UI writer as a UX program manager.
          We designed to empower ad-hoc communications with friends and coworkers across Windows Live suite in various contexts.
          The Web Messenger was launched successfully in September 2010, with <em>the first month uptake with 65M unique users</em>.
